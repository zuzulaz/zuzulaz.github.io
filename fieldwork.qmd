I enjoy a lot doing fieldwork. So far, I have had the opportunity to participate in and lead several fieldwork campaigns, mostly during my PhD studies. Majority of the fieldwork has been focused on studying foraging and migratory movements of birds by deploying GPS and GLS (geolocaor, light lever logger) devices, taking blood and feather samples for stable isotope analysis.
