One of my visualizations, *Where do shearwaters go?*, was featured in an online magazine *SciArt Magazine* (not active currently) run by the *SciArt Initiative*.        

This visualization was later [long-listed](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4820-where-do-shearwaters-go)  in the *Information is Beautiful Awards 2022* run by *Data Visualization Society*.
