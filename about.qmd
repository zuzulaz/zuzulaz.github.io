:::

I am an ecologist with a strong background in data science, specializing in the movement ecology of animals, particularly their migration strategies and foraging patterns. My expertise lies in processing data from bio-logging devices to describe and model migratory routes, identify stopovers and residency in non-breeding areas, as well as their relationship with the environment. I am also passionate about data visualization, exploring new ways to create effective and beautiful graphics that turn data into accessible knowledge for the scientific community and the general public.
